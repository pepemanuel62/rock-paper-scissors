//Your game will be played against the computer. You will write a function that randomly returns “rock”, “paper” or “scissors”.

/*Create a new function named getComputerChoice.
Write the code so that getComputerChoice will randomly return one of the following string values: “rock”, “paper” or “scissors”.
Hint: The Math.random method returns a random number that’s greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1. Think about how you can 
use this to conditionally return one of the multiple choices. 
Note: Some learners might think that arrays are necessary for this problem,
but they aren’t. If you’re unfamiliar with arrays, don’t worry - they’ll be covered later in the curriculum.
Test that your function returns what you expect using console.log or the browser developer tools before advancing to the next step.*/

 //function getComputerChoice() {}
